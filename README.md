Hi there, it's Daniel George Ashok! ðŸ‘‹  
I am an electronics and communications engineering student based in Bangalore with a passion for embedded systems. Whether it's tinkering with microcontrollers or building IoT projects, I'm always up for a challenge.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various embedded systems projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with hardware and software integration.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-george-ashok/).  
âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not working on electronics, you might find me cooking up something interesting in the kitchen or exploring the latest tech trends.

If you're looking for someone with a knack for embedded systems, let's connect!
