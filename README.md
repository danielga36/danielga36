Hey there, it's Daniel George Ashok! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m an electronics and communications engineering student in Bangalore, with a not-so-secret obsession with embedded systems. When I'm not buried in circuit boards, you might find me trying to convince my gadgets to work just the way I want (with varying degrees of success).

- ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the world of microcontrollers and IoT, working on various embedded systems projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with hardware and software integrationâ€”because who doesn't love making things smarter? ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-george-ashok/). 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once spent hours troubleshooting a wireless messaging system, only to find the issue was a mismatched baud rate. Always double-check those settings! ðŸ˜…

If youâ€™re an employer in Bangalore (or anywhere else, really) looking for someone to tinker with your embedded systems and make them do cool things, Iâ€™m your person! ðŸ˜„
